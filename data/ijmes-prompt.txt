All technical terms from Arabic must be fully transliterated with diacritical marks (macrons and dots), e.g., ʿashāʾ. A technical term is defined as a word for which there is no English equivalent and that is not found in Merriam–Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary, or a multi-word phrase, excluding names and titles as detailed in below.

Words found in Merriam–Webster’s should be spelled as they appear there and not treated as technical terms. They should have no diacritics - for example, mufti, jihad, shaykh. See the IJMES Word List (PDF) for exceptions that preserve ʿayn and hamza, for example, Qurʾan, shariʿa, ʿulamaʾ, and Kaʿba.

Diacritics should not be added to personal names, place names, names of political parties and organizations, or titles of books and articles. These words should be spelled in accordance with the IJMES transliteration system but without diacritics. However, ʿayn and hamza should be preserved in all these cases (except for initial hamza, which is dropped). Follow English capitalization rules: for example, al-Ikhwan al-Muslimun. IJMES follows "accepted English spellings" for names of prominent figures, places and organizations, historical or contemporary, e.g., Gamal Abdel Nasser, Faten Hamama, Ruhollah Khomeini, Benazir Bhutto, Maimonides.

Follow English capitalization rules for transliterated titles. Capitalize all major terms, but not articles, prefixes, coordinating conjunctions, or prepositions (even when joined to pronouns). Do NOT include diacritical marks but do preserve ʿayn and hamza. For example: Faysal al-Tafriqa bayn al-Islam wa-l-Zandaqa; al-Nur al-Safirʿan Akhbar al-Qarn al-ʿAshir. 

When in doubt, follow the spelling of the term in the script of the original language, not its oral pronunciation. There are only a few exceptions (e.g., iḍāfa constructions), which are detailed on this page.

For colloquial transliterations, refer to an English-colloquial dictionary for that language. Use a consistent colloquial transliteration system, preferably one that is as close as possible to the IJMES system.

The Arabic tāʾ marbūṭa is rendered a not ah. In Persian it is ih. In Arabic iḍāfa constructions, it is rendered at: for example, thawrat 14 Tammūz. The Persian izafat is rendered -i: for example, vilāyat-i faqīh.

The nisba ending is rendered -iyya in Arabic (e.g., Misriyya) and -iyyih in Persian.

Inseparable prepositions, conjunctions, and other prefixes are connected with what follows by a hyphen: bi-, wa-, li-, la-. Example: fī al-ʿIraq wa-Misr. (Note: the preposition fī is not an inseparable prefix in the Arabic script and thus is not treated as one by IJMES.)

Ellision. When one of the above prepositions or conjunctions is followed by al, the a will elide, forming a contraction rendered as wa-l-, bi-l-, li-l-, and la-l-. Example: fī Miṣr wa-l-ʿIrāq.

Initial hamza is always dropped.

The definite article (e.g., the Arabic al-) is lowercase everywhere, except in the first word of a sentence or an endnote. 

Connectors in names—such as bin, ben, abu, etc.—are lowercase only when preceded by a name, e.g., Ali ibn Abi Talib, Abu Ammar, Ibn Khaldun, Bint al-Shati.

Persian must be transliterated using the IJMES system, not that of the Encyclopaedia Iranica, so i and u must be used, not e and o.

Just as modern Turkish no longer uses hatted vowels (â), IJMES does not either.

Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary IJMES and Cambridge University Press use Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary to determine whether a foreign-language word has an accepted English spelling. Except for words included in the IJMES Word List (above), any word that appears in Webster’s should be spelled as it appears there, without italicization or diacritical marks. Words that are neither in Webster’s nor the IJMES Word List are considered “technical terms” and must be transliterated, with diacritics, according to the IJMES Transliteration Guide and Transliteration Chart above, except in cases outlined in the Transliteration Guide (titles, names, etc).
